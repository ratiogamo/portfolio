Guide: How This Replit App Was Converted to Netlify
Based on examining the commit history, I've created a guide showing how this portfolio application was successfully converted from Replit to Netlify:

1. Removed Replit-Specific Code
Removed the Replit development banner script from client/index.html
Removed Replit-specific plugins from vite.config.ts including @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal and @replit/vite-plugin-cartographer
2. Converted to a Static Site Architecture
Removed server-side components (deleted server/vite.ts and other server files)
Deleted server/storage.ts which handled database operations
Removed API routes and endpoints
Simplified components to use static data instead of fetching from APIs
3. Updated Import Paths
Added file extensions to imports (e.g., @/components/ui/toaster → @/components/ui/toaster.tsx)
Updated relative paths to ensure proper resolution during build
4. Added Netlify Configuration
Created a netlify.toml file:

[build]
  publish = "client/dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

5. Updated Build Configuration
Modified Vite configuration to optimize for static site deployment
Configured the build output directory to match Netlify's expected structure
6. Removed Database Dependencies
Removed PostgreSQL dependencies and configuration
Removed Drizzle ORM setup
Hardcoded data that was previously stored in the database
This approach leverages Netlify's strengths as a static site host while simplifying the application architecture, resulting in a fast, reliable portfolio site that's easy to deploy and maintain.
